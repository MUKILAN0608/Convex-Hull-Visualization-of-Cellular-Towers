# Convex-Hull-Visualization-of-Cellular-Towers
This repository contains a Python program that processes a dataset of cellular towers and visualizes their locations on an interactive map. It also calculates the Convex Hull of the selected tower locations using the Graham Scan Algorithm and saves the details of the vertices and internal points to an Excel file.
